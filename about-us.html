                        <p>A young car enthusiest Chris Jones started a little customs shop in queenstown. He hired some old friends and they mostly just helped fix cars. But in the weekends, when the customers went home Chris modified his own car a 1990 Nissan R34. He turned this car into a beast and drove it to track days and races winning many times over.</p>

Chris and the team got them all race ready and helped start many racing careers for drivers, mechanics, and principles alike.</p>
